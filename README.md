## Features

- Use of google maps
- Geocoding integration
- Firebase for authentication
- Address autocomplete
- Custom bookmarks

## Important

This application only uses the google map, the routes, polylines and the autocomplete are from third parties. To have a better result, it is best to use the libraries offered by the google suite that work very well together.

## Installation

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and
[Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed on your computer.

## Note
